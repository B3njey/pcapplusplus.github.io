## Step 1 - install PcapPlusPlus

As of now FreeBSD is only supported in `master` branch of PcapPlusPlus. It is not supported in the latest release (__{{ site.pcapplusplus-ver }}__).

In order to use PcapPlusPlus in FreeBSD you need to clone the latest version from `master` and follow the [installation guide](/docs/install/build-source/freebsd).

## Step 2 - create your first app

Please go to the [Hello World tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/tree/master/Examples/Tutorials/Tutorial-HelloWorld). It should exist on `/path/to/pcapplusplus/source/Tutorials/Tutorial-HelloWorld`.

Make sure you see the following files:

```shell
 |-- main.cpp
 |-- 1_packet.pcap
```

`main.cpp` is the example application we'll use.

`1_packet.pcap` is a pcap file the app reads from.

## Step 3 - create a Makefile

- go to the directory of the tutorial `/path/to/pcapplusplus/source/Tutorials/Tutorial-HelloWorld`
- rename `Makefile.non_windows` to `Makefile`

## Step 4 - build and run your app

Run `make` to build the app:

```shell
$ make
```

An executable file will be created which contains the compiled app. You can now run it and should be able to see the following output:

```shell
Source IP is '10.0.0.138'; Dest IP is '10.0.0.1'
```
