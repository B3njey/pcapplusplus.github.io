## Step 1 - install PcapPlusPlus

Before installing PcapPlusPlus make sure you have the prerequisites installed for [MacOS](/docs/install/build-source/macos#prerequisites).

The easiest way to get PcapPlusPlus is from Homebrew:

```shell
brew install pcapplusplus
```

If you prefer not to use Homebrew you can also found pre-compiled packages for various versions of MacOS and Xcode in the [latest release page](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/latest). After downloading and extracting the archive file go to: `/path/to/your/package/` and run the installation script:

```shell
./install.sh
```

Another option is to build PcapPlusPlus [from source](/docs/install/build-source/macos). Make sure not to skip the [installation](/docs/install/build-source/macos#installation) part.

## Step 2 - create your first app
